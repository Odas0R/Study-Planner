# Study-Planner

A simple todo-list with a pomodoro timer incorporated.
<br>
This is my first project, took a little time because
while i was learning i was adding concepts to the app.

## Features ‚≠êÔ∏è

- **LocalStorage**
- **Web Workers**
- **Draggable Todos and Lists**
- **Editable Todos**
- **Simple UI/UX**

## Aquired Concepts üìö

- **Why do we need Design Patterns** - My code went wild at some point, a complete mess.
- **Usabillity of Web Workers, why setTimeOut sucks üòÇ**
- **Better CSS/Sass Skills**
- **Working with Sass, which is way better than plain CSS. It's super flexible (It's a pre-processor)**
- **A little bit on WebWorkers & Performance**
- **Better Javascript Skills**
- **Understanding LocalStorage & Cookies**

### **Note** - Nowadays nobody builds apps like this. This was just for learning purposes.

#### Using React with Firebase would be a good choice of technologies for producing an app like this.
