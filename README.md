# Study-Planner
A simple todo-list with a pomodoro timer incorporated

<p>
This project is one of my firsts projects, the javascript syntax is kinda **uhh**.
This is just to show an idea and how i've represented it in code, it was a super fun because i had no idea how to do it...

<p>
I **encourage** you to make a project on your own, it's hella fun.
