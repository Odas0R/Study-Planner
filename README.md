# Study-Planner

A simple todo-list with a pomodoro timer incorporated

Also has localStorage integrated. Need to add WebWorkers in order to run the timer in the background.

This project is one of my firsts projects, the javascript syntax is kinda uhh.
This is just to show an idea and how i've represented it in code, it was a super fun because i had no idea how to do it...

I encourage you to make a project on your own, it's hella fun.
